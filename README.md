# weather-widget
 A simple application which search weather informations for the entered city with airport's weather informations.
 I use [METARS](https://aviationweather-cprk.ncep.noaa.gov/adds/dataserver_current/current/metars.cache.csv) weather informations and [airports informations](https://github.com/davidmegginson/ourairports-data) (btw thanks to [@davidmegginson](https://github.com/davidmegginson)).
